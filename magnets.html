        The new CMM product project required strong attractive forces to
        lock/unlock a hirth coupling mechanism in fixed angular positions when
        scanning.
        <br /><br />
        Using Finite Element Magnetics Modelling (FEMM4.2) with an iteration
        program run through Lua scripts, the forces between two N42 grade ring
        magnets with OD of 46mm and ID of 36mm were analyzed at thicknesses of 0
        to 10mm.

      <p>
        An analysis of two ring magnets with a fixed outer diameter of 46mm and
        a thickness of 3mm was automated using a Lua script to run a iterable
        internal radius from r=23mm to r=0mm.
        <br /><br />
        The results obtained show that decreasing the inner radius of the ring
        magnet increases the attractive force up to 16mm (ID32) (EDIT IMAGE
        XLABEL), where its slowly drops to 95N when it becomes a disk magnet.

        Another invstigation of the effect of magnetic flux containment with a
        stainless-steel housing around the magnet were undertaken.
        <br /><br />
        This was another considered option for the design of the probe because
        stonger attractive forces could be achieved between the steel encased
        magnets.
