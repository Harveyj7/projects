        Since all the prototyping could not be fully complete due to lack of
        resources, I moved my Final Year Project to a modelling task. The system
        was modelled on Simulink with all the forces acting on the glider in
        motion. First, the lift and drag forces on the glider were to be
        determined from CFX results. The glider oriented at a range of angles
        was modelled with laminar fluid flow. Using <b>Bernouille's Equation</b>
        <img class="equation" src="images/fluideq.png" />
        rearranged, the Drag and lift coefficients for each pitch angle could be
        calculated from the simulation results in the range of angles expected
        in its transit (+/-35 deg to the longditudinal axis). The drag
        coffecient was plotted against the pitch as shown. Using this, the CFD
        simulation was run for the glider travelling at 0.25m/s.

        These CFD results as well as other required parameters in the Bernouille
        Eq were then implemented as inputs into the Simulink model created to
        analyse the glider in motion. The model was set up with a vertical
        forces subsystem and a horizontal forces one.

        First, for the vertical forces subsystem, the free body diagram shown
        was assessed to obtain the governing equation which was expanded as
        shown given the buoyancy and weight definitions. This was then directly
        applied as the series of signals into the summation block in the
        simulink model (3rd image- click to zoom). A rotating model with the
        moments acting on the glider was also made to assess the glider rotation
        in pitch.

        There was a large set of valuable results obtained from the simulink
        model. Overall the main ones found were that the glider was found to
        reach a terminal velocity of approximately 0.1m/s at a pitch angle of
        35deg at steady state. Varying the motor control would allow the
        sawtooth profile of the glider to be controlled.
