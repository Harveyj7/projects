        My Final Year project involved the design and prototyping and analysis
        of an underwater “Nano” glider. Current gliders used in oceanography are
        generally large in scale, often surpassing 50kg in weight. However, for
        Limnological explorations, these large devices are impractical due to
        their lack of manoeuvrability in smaller environments. For this reason,
        the downscaling of underwater gliders is increasing in demand for a
        range of applications.

        The concept selected contains a reservoir connected to a miniature
        motor- pump. Water is ingested and expelled from the system through the
        reservoir to vary the system buoyancy. With hydrofoils attached to the
        hull the glider follows a saw-tooth profile through the water. The
        design was modelled in CAD and refined and iterated by assessing the
        forces and moments in bouyancy calculations document.

        First, the internal buoyancy system was prototyped, with the components
        3D printed, laser cut and the reversable motor- pump purchased used.
        Once successful buoyancy variation was achieved, the external hull and
        hydrofoils were prototyped and the whole system assembled. The
        electronic circuit system used to control the motor speed and direction
        was then set up.

        A preliminary functioning prototype was made, however, as the
        prototyping phase of the project was ceased due to corona virus and
        university facilities were closed, the development on the glider was
        limited and issues with purchased components hindered the development of
        the system. As a result, the project was diverged towards modelling and
        simulating the system to develop an insight into the performance
        characteristics of the finished product.
